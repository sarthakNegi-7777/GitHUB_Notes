Ques3 - Difference between forking and cloning ?
->
Forking : creates your own copy of a repository in a remote location (for example, GitHub). Your own copy means that you will be able to contribute changes to your copy of the repository without affecting the original repository.
Cloning : makes a local copy of a repository, not your own copy. Think of it as downloading a repository onto your local hard drive. Unlike forks, clones have references to their original repositories.


Ques4 - How to contribute to other repositories through GitHub ?
->
here are the steps :-
	1) Go to the repo you want to contribute to.
	2) fork the repo to your GitHub account.
	3) clone the forked repo to create a local copy of the repo.
	4) create a new branch for your contribution.
	5) make the changes.
	6) commit changes and push it to your forked repo.
	7) create a pull request :
			-> Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
			-> Click on the "compare & pull request" button next to the branch you just pushed.
			-> Provide a descriptive title and details for your pull request.
			-> Click on "create pull request".
	8) discuss and review your pull request.
	9) merge pull request :
			-> once your request is approved by the owner then your contribution will be merged into the main project.
	10) you can sync your forked repo with the original repo (optional).
